# dh140 intro
**Hello!** <br /> My name is **Yahaira** and I am currently a **4th year** *Cognitive Science* major, *Digital Humanities* minor <br /> 
When not in class, I like to watch KDramas and relax with my cat (:  <br /><br />

**DH140** is a upper-division digital humanities course that allows students to further explore the integration of computing and humanities. Students will be expected to apply concepts of computing to research in topics within the humanities and/or social sciences. <br /><br />

In regards to *projects ideas*, at the moment I am still not too sure of what I want to research and am pretty open to ideas. However, I have done past projects regarding social issues, such as police brutality within the NYPD specifically, and am also open to continuing this type of research. <br /><br /> 

My **_objectives_** for this course include:
- Becoming more proficient in the Python language
- Grow more comfortable with computing in general
- Discover new ways to apply computing concepts to more humanities-based topics or tasks, or in general gain a better understanding of how applications of computing could help further research in humanities-based topics or tasks
